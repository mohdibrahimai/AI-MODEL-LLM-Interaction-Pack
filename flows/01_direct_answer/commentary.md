## Direct answer flow: commentary

**Why the “bad” example is weak:** it never actually answers the question.  Instead of stating the capital, it distracts with unrelated facts about French cities.  There are no citations, so the reader cannot verify any claims.

**What improves in the “better” example:** it eventually names Paris and provides a citation, but the answer still buries the lead.  The first sentence is long and mixes the answer with unnecessary background.

**Why the “best” example works:** the answer leads with the requested information ("Paris is the capital of France") and cites the appropriate source immediately.  Additional context is short and relevant.  This pattern—answer first, cite, then expand—is used throughout the improved system.
