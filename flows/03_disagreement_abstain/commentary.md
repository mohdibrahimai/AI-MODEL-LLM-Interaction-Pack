## Disagreement/abstain flow: commentary

**Why the “bad” example is weak:** it presents misinformation and scientific fact as equally valid, encouraging the reader to “explore” conspiracy theories.  This abdicates responsibility and fails to help the user discern truth from falsehood.

**What improves in the “better” example:** it states that the scientific consensus is that the Earth is round, but it still does not cite evidence or address the flat‑Earth claim head‑on.  Without a citation or rationale, a sceptical user may remain unconvinced.

**Why the “best” example works:** it directly acknowledges that competing sources exist, then unequivocally states the well‑supported answer and cites evidence.  It explains *why* the answer is accepted (satellite imagery, gravity, astronomical observations) and notes that flat‑Earth claims lack empirical support.  This pattern helps users navigate conflicting information responsibly.
