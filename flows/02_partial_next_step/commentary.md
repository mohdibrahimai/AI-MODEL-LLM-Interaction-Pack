## Partial answer + next step flow: commentary

**Why the “bad” example is weak:** it confidently asserts that sunlight *always* improves mood without evidence.  It ignores the part of the query asking how to research the topic and gives potentially harmful advice.

**What improves in the “better” example:** the answer hints at uncertainty and suggests looking at journals or official sources, but it still makes unsubstantiated claims and lacks citations.  The recommendation to spend time outdoors may not apply to everyone.

**Why the “best” example works:** it clearly states what is known (moderate sunlight exposure can have benefits) and flags that results vary.  It directs the user to specific next steps—reading peer‑reviewed articles or official guidance and consulting professionals—while citing a credible source.  This pattern—answer what can be answered, acknowledge gaps, and propose a concrete next action—is used throughout the improved system for partially answerable queries.
