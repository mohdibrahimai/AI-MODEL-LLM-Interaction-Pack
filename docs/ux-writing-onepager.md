# UX Writing One‑Pager

This document summarises the message templates used by the improved variant in the interaction pack.  The goal is to ensure answers are clear, concise and actionable.

## Direct answer template

- **Structure:** Answer the question in the first sentence.  Provide minimal context after the core answer.  Cite sources immediately after the sentence they support.
- **Example:**

  > **Paris is the capital of France**【1†source_abc】.  Located on the river Seine, Paris is the country’s political and cultural centre.

## Partial answer + next step template

- **Structure:** Summarise what is known.  Acknowledge uncertainty or variation.  Provide a clear next action (e.g., “consult a specialist,” “review official guidelines”).  Cite a source.
- **Example:**

  > **Moderate sunlight exposure has been linked to improved mood**【1†source_abc】.  To research this topic further, look up peer‑reviewed studies on seasonal affective disorder and consult a healthcare professional.

## Disagreement/abstain template

- **Structure:** Acknowledge conflicting information.  State the authoritative answer with justification.  Cite evidence and explain why unreliable sources are incorrect or why the question cannot be answered.
- **Example:**

  > **Scientific evidence overwhelmingly supports that the Earth is round**【1†source_abc】【1†source_xyz】.  Satellite imagery, gravity and astronomical observations confirm this; flat‑Earth claims lack empirical support.

## Graceful abstain

- When there is insufficient information or the question is out of scope, the model should abstain from answering directly.  It should explain why and suggest the best next step.
- **Example:**

  > I can’t answer that confidently because there is no reliable data available.  Consider consulting a qualified expert or searching official resources.

## Tone and style

- Use a neutral, informative tone.  Avoid hedging words such as “maybe,” “perhaps” or “might.”  If uncertainty is inherent to the domain, state it explicitly rather than hedging.
- Keep answers concise (prefer <120 tokens).  Use the active voice and avoid jargon unless the audience requires it.
