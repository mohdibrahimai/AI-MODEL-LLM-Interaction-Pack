"""Normalize the tone of answers.

The `normalize_tone` function removes common hedging words (e.g., "might",
"maybe", "perhaps") and trims extra whitespace.  It is meant to make
answers more direct and confident without changing factual content.  In a more
robust system, this function could handle register shifts or domainâ€‘specific
style guides.
